            <p>
           Rent-Lion faced the challenge of creating a unified web, iOS, 
           and Android experience that would enable rental prospects to seamlessly apply for 
           housing and facilitate monthly rent payments once they become tenants. The complexity 
           increased due to the necessity of incorporating third-party credit checking services.

            As the Product Manager for the Rent-Lion project, I spearheaded a Google Design Sprint to facilitate the discovery of optimal user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) solutions. This sprint, rooted in Google's renowned design thinking framework, allowed our cross-functional team to converge on innovative ideas, rapidly prototype solutions, and validate them with users, all within a condensed timeframe. Through divergent thinking exercises, we explored various design concepts, and then, by converging our ideas, we refined and selected the most promising solutions. Our focus on understanding user pain points and iterating on design concepts during the sprint yielded valuable insights, enabling us to align the product's UX and UI with user needs effectively. The Google Design Sprint served as a pivotal catalyst in our journey to create an intuitive and user-centric property management solution.
